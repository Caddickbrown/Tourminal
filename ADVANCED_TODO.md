# Advanced Python To-Do List

Inspired by recent discussions, these tasks outline potential improvements using more advanced Python features and architectural ideas.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Structure & Organization
- [ ] Migrate journal entry and configuration data to `dataclasses` for clearer type hints and easier extension.
- [ ] Break the monolithic `daily_journal.py` into logical packages/modules for better maintainability and testing.
- [ ] Add unit tests for new modules as part of the refactor.

## ⚙️ Async & Background Tasks
- [ ] Investigate running lengthy exports (PDF/HTML) in a background process or thread with a progress indicator.
- [ ] Consider an `asyncio` or multiprocessing approach for any future cloud sync features.

## 🔌 Plugin Architecture
- [ ] Design a lightweight plugin API to allow optional features without bloating the core application.
- [ ] Implement dynamic importing of plugins from a dedicated `plugins/` directory.

## 🚀 Performance Enhancements
- [ ] Implement caching or lazy loading for large journals to speed up search and tag analytics.
- [ ] Profile memory usage and optimize for long-running sessions.

## 📅 Long-Term Ideas
- [ ] Build a writing analytics dashboard once the core refactor is complete.
- [ ] Revisit concurrency options (threads/processes) if future features require heavy background work.
